# tfSeqModel

This repository contains 4 files demonstrating sequence (Time Series) model using tensor flow.

Each of the file contains:

1. tfsmA: Constructing a synthetic dataset and forcast it using statistical and Machine learning model
2. tfsmB: Generate forecast for synthetic dataset using deep neural network
3. tfsmC: Using convolution with LSTM for forcasting a Synthetic data
4. tfsmD: Predicting Sunspots.
